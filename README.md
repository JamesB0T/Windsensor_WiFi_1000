## The Windsensor WiFi 1000 is a OpenSource project to build windsensor for sailboats with 3D printer parts and a ESP8266

My windsensor was defect in the last winter time 2018 by a big storm in Netherlands. I needed a new windsensor for my small sailboat. It is a Dehlya 22. I seached a interesting and usefully project for my new 3D printer. At first I try to build the hemispheric parts and the rotor. After successfully 3D printing I was amazed about the good quality and mechanical precisition. My printer is a low cost Chinise model JGAurora in prusa design. At this point I started my project with the windsensor and I designed all parts in 3D for my printer.

I bublished the project in the german sail forum [www.segeln-forum.de](https://www.segeln-forum.de/board1-rund-ums-segeln/board35-bootstechnik-und-elektronik/67401-windsensor-diy/) and found a lot of interested poeple. Afte a half year was all mecanical components and elektrical shematics finished and I could try the first windsensor successfully on my sailboat.

These are my conditions for the new windsensor:

    * Measuring from wind speed and wind direction
    * Robust mechanics
    * Weight <= 200g
    * Small enought for a 22 feed sailboad
    * Weatherproof and UV stable
    * Visible by night
    * No cabeling for sensor signals
    * Only digital signal transmission with WiFi
    * 12V power supplay from top light
    * Using a ESP8266 for WiFi and data handling
    * Update rate app. 1...2 samples per secounds
    * No onboard instrument necessary
    * Visualitation in OpenPlotter via laptop, mobile fone or tablett
    * No software installation unnecessary (display is the browser)
    * Supported protocol NMEA 0183
    * Preice <= 250 Euro
